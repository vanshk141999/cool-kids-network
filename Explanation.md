# Cool Kids Network - WordPress Plugin

## Problem Statement

The Cool Kids Network is a WordPress-based user management system that allows users to register, get automatically assigned characters, and interact based on role-based permissions. The system implements a hierarchy of roles (Cool Kid, Cooler Kid, Coolest Kid) with increasing levels of access to other users' information.

## Technical Specification

### Architecture Overview

The plugin is built using modern Object-Oriented Programming principles in PHP, organized into several key components:

1. **Frontend Class** (`includes/frontend.php`)

   - Handles all frontend rendering through WordPress shortcodes
   - Manages user interface components for login, signup, and dashboard
   - Implements role-based access control for viewing user data

2. **User Management Class** (`includes/user-management.php`)

   - Handles user registration and login logic
   - Integrates with randomuser.me API for generating fake identities
   - Manages user metadata and role assignments

3. **API Class** (`includes/api.php`)

   - Provides REST API endpoints for the system
   - Handles authentication and role management

4. **Admin Class** (`includes/admin.php`)
   - Manages administrative interfaces and settings

### Design Patterns Used

- **Singleton Pattern**: Implemented through the `Get_Instance` trait to ensure single instance of core classes
- **Namespace Usage**: Proper PHP namespacing (`CKN\Includes`) for better code organization
- **WordPress Integration**: Leverages WordPress hooks and filters for seamless integration

   ```
   [ckn_register]
   ```

2. Login Form:

   ```
   [ckn_login]
   ```

3. User Dashboard:

2. If login issues occur:
   - Ensure using the correct email address
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Request administrator assistance if needed

## Conclusion

The Cool Kids Network plugin successfully implements most of the core requirements, providing a solid foundation for user management and role-based access control. The pending items primarily relate to the API endpoint implementation and the bonus features around testing and automation.
